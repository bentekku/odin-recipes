      This is a flavorful chicken dish, which I first tasted at a little
      Lebanese restaurant. While normally shawarma is sliced off a rotisserie,
      it can be made at home with just a few changes. Be warned, it takes a day
      of prep time. For lunch, serve as a sandwich in warmed flatbread with
      cucumber sauce, sliced onion, and seeded tomato. For dinner, serve with
      rice and lentils.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>cup plain yogurt</li>
      <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>
        2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch strips
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk yogurt, lemon juice, olive oil, tomato paste, garlic, cumin,
        coriander, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl. Mix
        in chicken strips. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and place in the
        refrigerator to marinate, 8 hours to overnight.
      </li>

      <li>
        Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's
        broiler.
      </li>

      <li>
        Remove chicken from the bowl and arrange in a single layer on a broiling
        pan. Discard excess marinade.
      </li>

      <li>
        Broil chicken, turning once, until juices run clear, about 10 minutes.
        An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
        least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
