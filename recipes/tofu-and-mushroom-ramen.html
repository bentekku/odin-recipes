      Good for college kids trying to impress somebody or a quick family meal.
      Can be made in one pot, so that's nice. Save the ramen seasoning and make
      a really unhealthy dip with sour cream or Greek yogurt for later. Serve
      with Sriracha and soy sauce on the side.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package mushrooms, chopped</li>
      <li>½ (16 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>1 medium shallots, minced</li>
      <li>6 cups water 2 tablespoons red miso paste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chicken soup base (such as Better than Bouillon®)</li>
      <li>4 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles (flavor packets discarded)</li>
      <li>1 bunch green onions, chopped</li>
      <li>2 medium carrots, julienned</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat canola and sesame oils in a 6-quart stockpot over medium-high until
        hot. Add mushrooms and tofu and sautè for 5 minutes. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add butter to the hot pot and swirl to almost melt. Add shallot and cook
        until fragrant, about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in water and stir in miso paste and chicken base until they are
        dissolved. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, reduce heat, and
        simmer for 3 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Distribute mushrooms and tofu amongst 4 bowls.</li>
      <li>
        Bring liquid in the pot back to a boil and add ramen bricks, 1 at a
        time. Boil each brick for 1 minute, remove from broth with a ladle, and
        set into a serving bowl. Ladle additional broth on top so the ramen
        noodles continue cooking.
      </li>
      <li>Garnish each bowl with green onions and carrots.</li>
    </ol>
